## Abstract
we want to build an online system for delivering packages through drones (delivery drones), as a service. 
Basic need: a user wants to send a package (of some weight) from one place to other place, on some specific date/time 
(including immediately), within some amount of time. The user may want to track the delivering process, knowing exactly 
where the package is and how much time is left to complete the delivery.
